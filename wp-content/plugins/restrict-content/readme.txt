Run your own membership website using the Restrict Content membership plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Restrict Content is a simple membership plugin that enables you to easily restrict access to your content to logged-in users only.

Content restriction works both with partial content restrictions using shortcodes, as well as full page restrictions for post, pages, and most custom post types.

Restrict Content also includes frontend forms for user registration, login, and password reset so your members can do all these actions on the front end of your site without going to the wp-admin or wp-login.php pages. Display these with the [login_form] and [register_form] shortcodes.

= Features of the plugin =

* Limit access to content with a shortcode, i.e. `[restrict]This content is limited to logged in users.[/restrict]`.
* Limit access to full content via a simple interface on the edit post, page, and custom post type screens.
* Display a registration form for new accounts on any page of your website with `[register_form]`.
* Display a log in form for existing users on any page of your website with `[login_form]`.

A [Pro version of Restrict Content](https://restrictcontentpro.com/?utm_campaign=restrict-content&utm_medium=readme&utm_source=description&utm_content=first-mention) is also available with an extensive feature set.

= Restrict Content Pro features =

* Payments - including one-time payments and recurring subscriptions.
* Integration with popular payment systems, including Stripe, PayPal Standard, PayPal Express, PayPal Pro, Authorize.net, 2Checkout, and Braintree.
* Discount codes
* Printable HTML invoices
* Complete member management
* Prevent account sharing
* WooCommerce integration
* And much more. See the [Features](https://restrictcontentpro.com/tour/features/?utm_campaign=restrict-content&utm_medium=readme&utm_source=description&utm_content=features-link) page for additional details.

== Installation ==

1. Upload restrict-content to wp-content/plugins
2. Click "Activate" in the WordPress plugins menu
3. Go to Settings > Restrict Content and customize the Message settings
4. Follow instructions below to restrict content

To restrict an entire post or page, simply select the user level youâ€™d like to restrict the post or page to from the drop down menu added just below the post/page editor.

To restrict just a section of content within a post or page, you may use shortcodes like this:

[restrict userlevel="editor"] . . . your restricted content goes here . . . [/restrict]

Accepted userlevel values are:
 * admin
 * editor
 * author
 * subscriber
 * contributor

There is also a short code for showing content only to users that are not logged in.

[not_logged_in]This content is only shown to non-logged-in users.[/not_logged_in]
