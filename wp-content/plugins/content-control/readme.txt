Restrict content to logged in/out users or specific user roles. Restrict access to certain parts of a page/post. Control the visibility of widgets.

== Description ==

Content Control by [Jungle Plugins][jungleplugins] is a lightweight and powerful plugin that allows you to take complete control of your website’s content by restricting access to pages/posts to logged in users, specific user roles or to logged out users.

The plugin also enables you to restrict access to certain parts of a page/post using shortcodes e.g [content_control]Logged in content[/content_control]

Lastly, the plugin allows you to control the visibility of each sidebar/footer widget by selecting who can view each widget (everyone, logged out users, logged in users, specific user roles).

__Full Feature List__

Content Control allows you to do the following:

- Restrict access to pages/posts to logged in/out users or specific user roles
- Restrict access to media, tags, categories, format to logged in/out users or specific user roles
- Display a custom message to users who do not have permission to view the content

- Display certain content on a page/post to logged in users only
- Display certain content on a page/post to specific user roles
